About me, and what you can expect from this blog.

I am a computer science undergrad with a profound interest in Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Math and Space. I try to learn new stuff as much as I can during my free time and this blog is just a medium I chose to share the knowledge I gain or rant about what makes me curious.

***What you can expect from this blog:***
- Algorithm concepts
- Math Concepts
- NLP and Computer Vision related stuff
- Any roadblocks I face while learning and how I overcome these
- Im currently in

I am currently trying to use the quarantine time to its fullest so as to build on my skills and make small but consistent steps towards becoming a 10X engineer. 

Prior to this, I was using medium.com to publish my blogs and am working on porting those old blogs here. For the time being, you can head over to [medium/@adityaananthram](https://medium.com/@adityaananthram) to check out those blogs.
